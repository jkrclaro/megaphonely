Mentions may be indecent, offensive, inaccurate, unlawful, or otherwise objectionable. Hootsuite has no obligation to preview, verify, flag, modify, filter, or remove any Mentions, even if requested to do so, although Hootsuite may do so in its sole discretion. Your use of Mentions is at your sole risk, and Hootsuite shall not be liable to you or any third party in relation to Mentions.</p>

When you access the Third-Party Services, you will do so at your own risk. These Third-Party Services may also allow you to store your Customer Content with the provider or operator of the Third-Party Services. Any use of Third-Party Services is governed solely by the terms and conditions of such Third-Party Services (and you shall comply with all such terms and conditions), and any contract entered into, or any transaction completed via any Third-Party Services, is between you and the relevant third party, and not Hootsuite.

<p><strong>2.7 Non-Exclusivity.</strong>&nbsp;You acknowledge that the rights granted to you under this Agreement are non-exclusive and that nothing in this Agreement will be interpreted or construed to prohibit or in any way restrict Hootsuite’s right to license, sell, or otherwise make available the Services to any third party or perform any services for any third party.</p>
<p><strong>2.8 Beta Testing.&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;From time to time, we may offer you the opportunity to install, use and test (the "<strong><u>Beta Testing</u></strong>") certain of our Services prior to their commercial release (the "<strong><u>Beta Services</u></strong>"). &nbsp;</p>

<p>(i) we grant you a limited right to use the Beta Services for Beta Testing purposes during the applicable testing period;</p>
<p>(ii) you agree to provide suggestions, comments, or other feedback with respect to the Beta Services as reasonably requested, including ideas for modifications and enhancements (the "<strong><u>Beta Feedback</u></strong>"). &nbsp;You hereby assign to us all right, title and interest in and to the Beta Feedback. &nbsp;All Beta Services and your Beta Feedback are Hootsuite’s Confidential Information, and Hootsuite may use your Beta Feedback in advertising and promotional materials with your prior consent (not to be unreasonably withheld);</p>
<p>(iii) we reserve the right to modify the Beta Services or terminate your participation in the Beta Testing for any reason, without liability to you. We will use commercially reasonable efforts to provide you with reasonable advance notice of such termination;</p>
<p>(iv) you acknowledge that the Beta Services are not at the level of performance or compatibility of a final, generally available product offering, and may be substantially modified prior to commercial availability, or withdrawn. &nbsp;We are under no obligation to provide technical support with regards to the Beta Services, and we provide no assurance that any specific errors or performance issues in the Beta Services will be corrected; and</p>
<p>(v) the Beta Services are provided on an "as is" and "as available" basis without any warranties or conditions of any kind, whether express, implied, statutory or otherwise.

<p><strong>3. Intellectual Property</strong></p>
<p><strong>3.1 Hootsuite Services.</strong>&nbsp;As between you and Hootsuite, Hootsuite retains all right, title, and interest in and to the Services. Nothing herein shall be construed to restrict, impair, encumber, alter, deprive, or adversely affect the Services or any of Hootsuite’s rights or interests therein or any other Hootsuite intellectual property, brands, information, content, processes, methodologies, products, goods, services, materials, or rights, tangible or intangible. All rights, title, and interest in and to the Services not expressly granted in this Agreement are reserved by Hootsuite. You may from time to time provide suggestions, comments or other feedback to Hootsuite with respect to the Services ("<strong><u>Feedback</u></strong>"). Feedback, even if designated as confidential by you, shall not create any confidentiality obligation for Hootsuite notwithstanding anything else. You shall, and hereby do, grant to Hootsuite a non-exclusive, worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, transferable, sublicensable, royalty-free, fully paid-up license to use and exploit the Feedback for any purpose.</p>
<p><strong>3.2 Customer Content.&nbsp;</strong>You grant Hootsuite a limited, worldwide, non-exclusive, non-transferable (except as set forth in Section 9.1) license, without a right of sublicense, to access, use, reproduce, electronically distribute, transmit, perform, format, display, store, archive, and index the Customer Content for the purpose of supporting your use of the Services and providing Services to you. Hootsuite may also use Customer Content for the purpose of supporting and developing the Services, provided that when doing so, Hootsuite shall only use Customer Content in an anonymized and aggregated way. Subject only to the limited license expressly granted herein, you and your Authorized Users shall retain all right, title and interest in and to the Customer Content and all intellectual property rights therein. Nothing in this Agreement will confer on Hootsuite any right of ownership or interest in the Customer Content or the intellectual property rights there</p>
<p><strong>3.3 Responsibility for Customer Content and Mentions.</strong>&nbsp;You are solely responsible for the Customer Content that you or Authorized Users upload, publish, display, link to, or otherwise make available via the Services, and you agree that Hootsuite is only acting as a passive conduit for the online distribution and publication of the Customer Content and the online display of Queries and Mentions. Hootsuite will not review, share, distribute, or reference any Customer Content or Mentions except as provided herein, as provided in&nbsp;<a href="http://hootsuite.com/legal/privacy" target="_self" data-di-id="di-id-5a729bf5-a9d0c385">Hootsuite’s privacy policy</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://hootsuite.com/legal/copyright" target="_self" data-di-id="di-id-b45ea6dc-71572ab8">copyright policy</a>, or as may be required by law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Hootsuite retains the authority to remove any Customer Content uploaded that it deems in violation of this Agreement, at its sole discretion.</p>
<p><strong>4. Hootsuite Products and Fees</strong></p>
<p><strong>4.1 Purchases By Authorization Form.</strong>&nbsp;If an Authorization Form is issued for the purchase of Services, you agree to pay all fees as and when described per the Authorization Form(s). Hootsuite shall invoice you for the fees in the currency set forth on the applicable Authorization Form. Unless otherwise stated on the Authorization Form, all invoices shall be payable within 30 days of the invoice date. Any disputed amounts shall not affect payment of non-disputed amounts. You shall make payments to the entity and address set forth in the invoice.</p>
<p><strong>4.2 Online Paid Services. &nbsp;</strong>For paid Services purchased online ("<strong><u>Online Services</u></strong>"), you must provide Hootsuite with a valid credit card or other payment method &nbsp;(e.g., PayPal account) to pay for such services. Some Services may be available as a one-time purchase, and others can be purchased as a monthly or yearly subscription. You agree that Hootsuite has permission to retain and/or share with financial institutions and payment processing firms (including any institutions or firms Hootsuite retains in the future) your submitted payment information in order to process your purchase. Depending on where you transact with us, the type of payment method used and where your payment method was issued, your transaction with us may be subject to foreign exchange fees or differences in prices, including because of exchange rates. Hootsuite does not support all payment methods, currencies, or locations for payment. If the payment method you use with us, such as a credit card, reaches its expiration date and you do not edit your payment method information or cancel or downgrade your account to a charge-free account, you authorize Hootsuite to continue billing your credit card and/or PayPal account and you remain responsible for any uncollected amounts. All applicable taxes are calculated based on the billing information you provide us at the time of purchase.</p>
<p><strong>4.3 Free Trial Period.</strong>&nbsp;If you sign up for a free trial period for a Service that is subject to charges (the "<strong><u>Free Trial</u></strong>"), we may require you to provide us with a valid credit card or other valid payment method. We may start charging you automatically on the first day after the Free Trial is over, unless you cancel or downgrade to a charge-free Service and uninstall any Apps or other items, as required for cancellation, before the end of the Free Trial period. Please note that prior to the end of the Free Trial Apps purchased via the Hootsuite App Directory may need to be uninstalled via the App Directory to avoid charges being incurred. The Free Trial is only available to first time users of a paid Online Service.</p>
<p><strong>4.4 </strong><strong>Subscription Services; Auto-renewal and Cancellation.</strong> &nbsp;If you are purchasing Online Services on a subscription basis, you may have the option to purchase a monthly or a yearly subscription, <strong>which will automatically renew</strong> at the end of its applicable term. Subscriptions are billed in advance on a monthly or yearly basis (as per the option chosen when you purchased such Online Services) and are non-refundable for the subscription period they are purchased for. You agree that Hootsuite may process your credit card or other valid payment method on each monthly, annual, or other renewal term (based on the applicable billing cycle), on the calendar day corresponding to the first day you subscribed to Online Services. If your paid subscription to Online Services began on a day not contained in a subsequent month (e.g., your service began on January 30 and there is no February 30), we will process your payment on the last day of such month. You may elect to cancel or downgrade your Online Services at any time by following the steps outlined <a href="https://help.hootsuite.com/hc/en-us/articles/204596100-Downgrade-to-Hootsuite-Free-Pro-and-Pro-Trial" target="_blank" data-di-id="di-id-82f79e26-3656c546">here</a>. Apps purchased via the Hootsuite App Directory must be uninstalled separately via the App Directory to avoid charges being incurred. If you subscribed to a monthly Hootsuite Pro plan (but not a Professional or Team plan), your account may immediately be downgraded to a charge-free account, and no credit or refund will be issued for any prepaid fees. If you subscribed to a monthly Professional or Team plan, the downgrade will only be effective at the end of the then-current monthly billing period, and no credits or refunds will be issued to you for any prepaid fees. If you subscribed to a yearly plan, the downgrade will only be effective at the end of the then-current annual billing period and no credits or refunds will be issued to you for prepaid fees. Online Services purchased for a one-time fee (such as Academy certifications) are not refundable.</p>
<p><strong>4.5 Late Payment.</strong>&nbsp;If any amounts due hereunder are not received by Hootsuite by the due date, then at Hootsuite’s discretion, such charges may accrue late interest at the rate of 12% per year or the maximum rate permitted by law, whichever is lower, from the date such payment was due until the date paid. In addition, upon 10 days' written notice, Hootsuite may suspend your access to the Services if Hootsuite does not receive the amounts invoiced hereunder at the expiration of such period.</p>
<p><strong>4.6 Taxes and Withholdings.</strong>&nbsp;You are responsible for paying all Taxes associated with your purchase of Services. If Hootsuite has the legal obligation to pay or collect Taxes for which you are responsible under this section, the appropriate amount shall be invoiced to and paid by you, unless you provide Hootsuite with a valid tax exemption certificate authorized by the appropriate taxing authority. Any and all payments by or on account of the compensation payable under this Agreement shall be made free and clear of and without deduction or withholding for any Taxes. If you are required to deduct or withhold any Taxes from such payments, then the sum payable shall be increased as necessary so that, after making all required deductions or withholdings, Hootsuite receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deduction or withholding been made.</p>
<p><strong>5. Term and Termination</strong></p>
<p><strong>5.1 Term of the Agreement ("<u>Term</u>").</strong>&nbsp;For Online Services, the term of this Agreement shall commence on the day you access the Services for the first time and shall continue until your subscription ends, or your account is cancelled and you cease using our Services.&nbsp; If you purchase Services via an Authorization Form, the term of this Agreement shall commence on the day you sign the Authorization Form and shall continue until your subscription ends, or your account is cancelled and you cease using our Services.</p>
<p><strong>5.2 Termination.</strong>&nbsp;If you violate the letter or spirit of this Agreement, abuse the Services, or otherwise create risk or possible legal exposure to Hootsuite, we can terminate or suspend your access to the Services at our sole discretion. We will use commercially reasonable efforts to notify you by email or at the next time you attempt to access your account. You may also cancel or disable Services at any time. For cancellation procedure, and for further assistance, see the instructions published&nbsp;<a href="https://help.hootsuite.com/hc/en-us/articles/204595980-Cancel-Your-Hootsuite-Account" target="_self" data-di-id="di-id-69888ef8-f75741bb">here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>5.4 Survival.</strong>&nbsp;Any provision of this Agreement which, either by its terms or to give effect to its meaning, must survive, and such other provisions which expressly, or by their nature, are intended to survive termination shall survive the expiration or termination of this Agreement.</p>

<p>THE PARTIES ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT THE ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF THIS SECTION IS TO ALLOCATE THE RISKS UNDER THESE TERMS BETWEEN THE PARTIES AND LIMIT THEIR POTENTIAL LIABILITY GIVEN THE FEES CHARGED UNDER THIS AGREEMENT, WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN SUBSTANTIALLY HIGHER IF HOOTSUITE WERE TO ASSUME ANY FURTHER LIABILITY OTHER THAN AS SET FORTH HEREIN.
